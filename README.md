**Flipbook2** is a sample project that implements a flip book effect using HDRP, its built-in post processing effects and the [KinoAqua] watercolor effect.

This is basically a reimplementation of the **[Flipbook]** project, which was originally made with the built-in render pipeline.
I ported the flip book shader (written as. a surface shader) to Shader Graph and also reconstructed other components using the HDRP features.
